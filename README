This is an alternative implementation of the MSN protocol plug-in for
libpurple.

It's based on the code from 2.2.2 but slowly becoming a completely different
code.

Features include:

 * Support for personal messages
 * Support for offline messaging (read-only)
 * Support for handwritten messages (read-only)
 * Server-side storage for display names (private alias)
 * Partial direct connection support (p2p transfers)
 * Improved network IO (using GIOChannel)
 * Improved error handling
 * Network issues tested with netem
 * GObject usage

Future plans:

 * Complete direct connection (Fast file-transfers)
 * Send custom simleys (for Pidgin 2.5)
 * MSNP15 support
 * Complete GObjectification
