This is an alternative implementation of the MSN protocol plugin for libpurple.

It's based on the code from 2.2.2 plues a few extras.

* Server-side storage for aliases
* Partial direct connection support
* Improved network IO
* Network problems tested with netem
* GObject usage

Future plans:

* Complete direct connection (Fast file-transfers)
* Send custom simleys
* MSNP10 support
* Personal messages
* Complete GObjectification

Some things will be done as workarounds/dirty hacks that's why this code is not proposed for merging into the official code.
