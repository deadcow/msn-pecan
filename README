This is an alternative implementation of the MSN protocol plug-in for
libpurple.

It's based on the code from 2.2.2 but slowly becoming a completely different
code.

Compared to Pidgin's official MSN plug-in:

 * Faster log-in
 * Fewer connection issues
 * Experimental direct connection support (fast file transfers)
 * Server-side storage for display names (private alias)
 * Support for handwritten messages (read-only)

Other features:

 * Support for personal status messages
 * Support for offline messaging (read-only)
 * Send custom emoticons (Pidgin >= 2.5)

Future plans:

 * Complete direct connection (fast file-transfers)
 * MSNP15 support
 * Complete GObjectification
